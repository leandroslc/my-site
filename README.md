<h1 align="center">My site 🌐</h1>

<p align="center">
  An attempt to create and keep my own site with a blog.
</p>

## :book: Purpose
A site about things that I wanted to know and that maybe should be important to other people.

## :gear: Requirements
- Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) v16.13.2+.

## :computer: Build and test
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
- Run `npm test` to run unit tests.
- Run `npm test:e2e` to run end-to-end tests (you may need to run `npx playright install` first).

## :hand: Contributing
This is a repository that probably only I will be maintaining mostly of the time, but if you want to contribute (that would be of much help :blush:), you can fork this repository and send a PR.
